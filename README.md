# Send-PushNotification

A handy little PowerShell function for sending out Push Notifications from Microsoft App Center.

## Installation

* Save the .psm1-file into a folder with the **same** name  - *Send-PushNotification*
* Copy the folder (containing the module file) into your ````PSModulePath````
* Now you have the function ready to go in your next PowerShell session

## Example:
````powershell
Send-PushNotification -Title "Hello World" -Body "Enter a fancy text here"
````
